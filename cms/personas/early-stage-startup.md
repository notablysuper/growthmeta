Companies that fit within the Early Stage Startup persona typically consist of companies between 10 - 50 employees, with pre-seed, seed, or bootstrap based funding. These companies are more more than likely product focused with little to no focus on marketing, or a new focus on Sales and Revenue.

In most cases, these companies will be B2B with a pseudo broad audience perspective.
