Companies that fit within the Funded Startup persona typically consist of companies between 75 - 500 employees, with Series A or bootstrap based funding. These companies are more more than likely product focused with little to no focus on marketing, or a new focus on Sales and Revenue. Companies in this segment typically have poor product market fit but a known revenue source from a specific audience. Likely lacking the right positioning required to execute on a multitude of target audiences.Companies in this Segment are B2B and B2C, however have no fully dialed in their marketing, sales, or customer success strategy.
