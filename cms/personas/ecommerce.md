Companies that fit within the eCommerce persona typically consist of companies between 10 - 100 employees. In most cases, these eCommerce companies consist of Subscription based retail such as reoccurring deliveries, direct to consumer brands, and retailers. Occasionally, B2B wholesalers will pop in this niche with a focus on omnichannel distribution.

These companies consist of either a strong brand or product with a lack of audience targeting. In most cases, these companies have a solid cash flow, little to no risk, and are looking to expand their CLTV, as well as first time buyers.
