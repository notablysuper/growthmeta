Building a strong data infrastructure empowers data driven decisions that deliver smart growth decisions.

The leading income-building platform for today’s workforce, Steady works at the intersection of income and finance to help future workers create a steadier month-to-month income. Since publicly launching in July 2018 they have acquired 700,000 members who are working toward a more solid financial future.

As a high growth startup, Steady was eager to attract new users and launch new features. To do so efficiently the team looked to answer core business questions. Where are users coming from? How are they converting through the funnel? What does a power user look like? And what user behaviors best drive retention? However their newly implemented tools for tracking user behavior and product performance each reported different outcomes – it didn’t add up. The result? Steady couldn’t fully trust their data. That’s when the team at Steady reached out to GrowthMeta to help develop a data infrastructure that could offer a single source of truth to support their growing company.

After reviewing the installed tools, GrowthMeta offered recommendations for improving their tech stack and built out a data warehouse that could support their growing need for advanced analytics. After syncing their data into the new warehouse, GrowthMeta developed a BI environment that connected user behavior and platform performance details to financial data so that Steady could see a three-dimensional view of their users.

“The team at GrowthMeta has been an integral part of our team in early days and helped us build the analytics infrastructure that powers every decision we make here at Steady” shares Oz Uzuner, Chief Operating Officer.

During this time, Steady began launching new features and worked closely with GrowthMeta to design an event schema for determining how key user interactions should be tracked across their platform. Through Segment Protocols, we helped Steady define their new data governance policy that dictated their QA steps and overall process for publishing to production.

Today, Steady is better positioned to employ analytics-driven growth decisions. Their new data infrastructure has enabled growth on all fronts, including key partnerships. Together these data-driven efforts supported over 400% user growth within 6 months of collaborating with the team at GrowthMeta.
