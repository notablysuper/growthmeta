**Key Results**
===============

*   Established a unifying event data layer with clear definitions powers all martech tools including conversion and revenue tracking events
*   Defined requirements, setup and tested integrations with [Segment.com](http://segment.com/), Tune, Impact Radius and Responsys.
*   Provided strategic research and design for a new affiliate marketing program which is now the most cost efficient channel of new users and subscribers
