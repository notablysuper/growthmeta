Casetext empowers litigators to perform faster, more accurate legal research. Today, more than one million legal professionals rely on Casetext’s suite of legal research tools including CARA, a machine learning research assistant.

**Big Challenge**
=================

Casetext built the most advanced library of legal case law on the market but without well-defined reports and business intelligence they were sentenced to a lifetime of guesswork.

**Solution**
============

After auditing the existing reporting and analytics infrastructure, GrowthMeta condensed hundreds of events down to just the essentials. Cutting the clutter helped Casetext to define strategic direction and dominate monthly board meetings.

**Key Results**
===============

*   4 real-time dashboards with 40+ metrics built to answer key business questions
*   1 new unified data schema condenses 170+ poorly performing data streams to 70
*   5 company wide ORKs defined, baselined and tracked using new data sets
