We focus on users as well as business operators responsible for maintaining and improving the experience.

Our recommendations are grounded by reality – what people actually do today and are likely to desire tomorrow. That’s our key input for envisioning an experience.

Our bias is to action. Prophet’s team of strategists, designers, data experts, and developers are committed to iterative prototyping almost from day one. We believe that real-world feedback from users and operators will always produce more successful and differentiated outcomes than “best practice” strategies alone.

We don’t stop at an idea that users want and operators can successfully run. What’s truly necessary is a business case that powerfully connects the experience to business benefits, and a roadmap that clearly communicates the actions and investments needed to deliver the experience at scale.
